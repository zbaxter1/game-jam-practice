Idea: Twin stick shooter/survivor like - simple prototype (test run)
Time limit: Needs to be done by January 12th 2024.

Plan: Pick apart a game to see whatâ€™s needed and figure out how to do it piece by piece 
Player - movement (8 way), shooting, death, controller support?
Enemies - rudimentary AI that allows them to chase player, damage dealt on contact or damage on attacks?, death
XP gain and levels - how player levels and way to pick skills, xp needed for level 
skill list - 5 to 10 skills that work for the prototype
weapons and/or equipment - 5 to 10 items, some weapons and some items that work for the prototype
Inventory - basic inventory or just item bar (few slots for items, weapons, potions)

Animations needed for player and enemies - idle, walk/run, attack, hit, death
Animation style - animated by hand or image bobbing left/right and using tweens and engine effects
